/**
 * This package provides the logic behind EMF Compare's matching process.

 * The metrics and similarity computation features are all provided by the classes
 * within these packages. {@link MetamodelFilter} allows us to filter unused 
 * attributes/references of the models, 
 * {@link org.eclipse.emf.compare.match.internal.statistic.NameSimilarity} is in
 * charge of computing String similarities and 
 * {@link org.eclipse.emf.compare.match.internal.statistic.StructureSimilarity} is
 * used to compute structural similarities on the EObjects.
