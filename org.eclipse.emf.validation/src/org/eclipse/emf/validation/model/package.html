Types defining the "data model" of the EMF Validation plug-in, in most
cases mapping directly to constructs in the <tt>constraintProviders</tt>
extension point schema.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
The classes and interfaces in this package, together with the public types
in the {@link org.eclipse.emf.validation} package, define the basic elements
of the model validation framework, constituting its data model.  These internal
types are required primarily by implementors of dynamic constraint providers
(in addition to the validation engine, itself).  Dynamic providers are currently
only supported internally; the public validation API supports only static,
XML-based contribution.
</p>

<p>
Dynamic constraint providers contribute implementations of the
{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.model.IModelConstraint} interface
to the system.  These may be implemented by classes defined by the provider,
or may be created from structured meta-data using a pre-defined constraint language
via the {@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.service.ConstraintFactory}
abstract factory class.  Constraints produce
{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.model.IConstraintStatus} objects
to indicate violations (or not) of constraints, generally through the
{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.IValidationContext} API (though not
necessarily so, in dynamic providers that use the <code>IModelConstraint</code>
interface).
</p>

<p>
In addition to defining the structure of constraints, this package also
provides the implementation of and access to constraint
{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.model.Category categories}.  These
are primarily used by the validation UI package to organize constraints in the
display and provide convenient groupings for enablement and disablement of
constraints.
