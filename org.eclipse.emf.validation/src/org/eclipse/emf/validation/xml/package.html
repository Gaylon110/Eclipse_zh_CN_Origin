The API for specification and processing of constraints in XML.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
The types in this package constitute the provisional API for constraints
contributed via XML from plug-in manifests.  The
{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.xml.XmlConstraintProvider} is
a constraint provider implementation that loads constraint meta-data from the
<tt>constraintProviders</tt> extension point into
{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.xml.IXmlConstraintDescriptor}s and
uses the {@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.service.ConstraintFactory}
to create constraint objects from them.
</p>

<p>
Dynamic constraint providers may use the API in this package to specify
constraints in languages that are supplied to the system by
other plug-ins, and use the <code>ConstraintFactory</code> to instantiate
constraints from these specifications:
<ul>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.xml.IXmlConstraintDescriptor}:
      the meta-data interface for constraints specified in plug-in manifest XML</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.xml.IXmlConstraintParser}:
      a constraint parser understands a constraint specification (in the form
      of an <code>IXmlConstraintDescriptor</code> in a particular language
      and can construct an implementation of the
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.model.IModelConstraint}
      interface from it</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.xml.XmlConstraintProvider}:
      the default provider implementation used by plug-ins that specify
      constraints in the XML.  Not generally used in any other way by plug-ins</li>
</ul>
