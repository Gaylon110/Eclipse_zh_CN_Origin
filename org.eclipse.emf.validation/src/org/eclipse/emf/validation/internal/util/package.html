Various utility classes and operations in support of the
EMF Validation plug-in.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
The hodge-podge of classes in this package provide a wide variety of functions
to the EMF Validation plug-in, from such cross-cutting concerns as logging and
tracing, to specialized functions such as instantiating constraints from
descriptors via an abstract factory.
</p>

<p>
None of the classes in this package is intended to be used by any other plug-in,
with the exception of a few that may be of use to constraint providers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.service.ConstraintFactory}:
      an abstract factory for the creation of constraint objects from
      descriptors.  A provider can leverage the extensible 
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.xml.IXmlConstraintParser constraint-parser}
      API to construct constraints implemented in languages that are supplied
      by other plug-ins.</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.internal.util.DisabledConstraintStatus}:
      a convenient {@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.model.IConstraintStatus}
      implementation indicating that a constraint has been disabled.  If a
      constraint implementation prefers not to throw an exception to the
      framework, it could conceivably use the
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.validation.IValidationContext} API to disable
      itself and return an instance of the <code>DisabledConstraintStatus</code>
      to indicate that it has been disabled</li>
</ul>
