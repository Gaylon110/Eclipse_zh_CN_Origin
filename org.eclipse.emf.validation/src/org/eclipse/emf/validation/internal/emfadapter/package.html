The EMF's validation adaptation classes in the EMF Validation plug-in.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
This package contains the classes that provide the &quot;EMF&quot; language for constraints.
The &quot;EMF&quot; language allows one to contribute constraints that reflectively
call a validation method that already exists on the EMF interface for a particular EObject.
