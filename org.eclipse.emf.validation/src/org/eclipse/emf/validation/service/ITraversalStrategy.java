/**

 * A strategy for traversal of one or more model sub-trees in batch validation.

 * also for updating the validation progress monitor periodically.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that traversal is performed over some number (possibly greater than one)
 * of <i>traversal roots</i>.  The validation system makes no assumption about
 * the relationships between these roots (e.g., containment), so it is up to
 * the strategy implementation to determine whether any optimization can be
 * made in processing these sub-trees (e.g., determining that some roots will be
 * covered by traversal of others).

	 *       nature of the metamodel and its client applications can be made)</li>
