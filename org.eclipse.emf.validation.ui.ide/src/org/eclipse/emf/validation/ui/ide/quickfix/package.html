"Quick fix" problem marker resolution strategies for problem markers created
from validation constraint violations.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
This package contains the default "quick fix" strategy which is simply to
disable the constraint the reported the problem indicated in a marker.
</p>
<p>
This package will also, in the future, define a mini-framework for constraint
providers to contribute fixes for their particular constraints, which actually
solve problems instead of sweeping them under the rug.
